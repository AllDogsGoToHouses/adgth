# :dog: All Dogs Go To Houses


## Overview
A web app that allows users to find a great match from local dog shelters.

Log in or create an account, and then flip through dogs currently seeking adoption. If you find a good match, you can favorite the pet and view it later under your favorites, which also contains dog shelter contact information.

Please try out the deployed app in Heroku, found [here](https://adgth.herokuapp.com/).

## Functionality
On the Front End, the app uses `Materialize`, `jQuery`, `AJAX`, and the HTML is rendered using `Handlebars`.

On the Back End, the app uses `Node.js` and `MySQL`. The Node Packages used in the app are `Sequelize` for database queries, `Express` for serving and routing, `Passport` for User Authenication, and `bcrypt-nodejs` for hashing user passwords.

For persistent data, the app uses 3 MySQL tables to store the `Dogs` and the `Shelters` the dogs are currently located. All users favorites and their contact information is stored in the `Adopter` table, which are all generated by the Sequelize ORM.
